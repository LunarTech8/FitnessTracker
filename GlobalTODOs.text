// Backlog:
// -------------

!!!- Description changes should be saved
!!!- Having entries with their dates not ascending causes wrong info for average interval
!- Adjust design to fit to all screen sizes (e.g. smaller width)
!- Increase performance when scrolling through exercises
!- Display "Enter Edit Mode"/"Leave Edit Mode" on the button instead of "Switch Edit Mode"
!- Add option to switch between colour themes
!- Make dark colour theme work
!- Find a solution to lose focus of an edit text when clicking on a disabled edit text

// Ideas/Concepts:

!!- Refactor the name labels for current studio and workout to better distinguish from the exercise name labels (maybe bold font)
!!- Have a button to change between lbs and kg
!- Maybe add different exercise types (one for cardio, etc.)
